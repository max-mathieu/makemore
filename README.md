# makemore (WIP)

Playing along with @karpathy's lectures (see links)

## Content

- `n-grams/bigram.ipynb` -- pretty much same as https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/blob/master/lectures/makemore/makemore_part1_bigrams.ipynb
- `n-grams/trigram.ipynb` & `n-grams/tetragram.ipynb` -- same as `bigram.ipynb` just to practice pytorch & tensor broadcasting, and see mean log likelihood go down (and increasingly better results)
- `n-grams/tetragram-less-mem.ipynb` -- a rewrite to reduce number of parameters
- `n-grams/n-gram.ipynb` -- a generic version that can do all the above and more
